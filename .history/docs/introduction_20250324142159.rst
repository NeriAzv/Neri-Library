Introduction to Neri Library
============================
The Neri Library is a portfolio where interested parties can study my codes or assess my knowledge.

I created this advanced Python library for task automation, browser interaction, API manipulation, and more, all aimed at RPA processes. It is designed to facilitate the creation of robust and efficient scripts, especially for web scraping and integration with third-party programs.

Key Features:

- **Driver**: Initialize various browsers with stealth configurations (to avoid CAPTCHAs and others), bug prevention (like starting in the same version as your machine's browser), and simplified functions such as adding extensions and other useful arguments for customization. All this is already implemented, minimizing the amount of code in your script while reducing bugs and complexity.
- **API**: Integration with external APIs for HTTP requests.
- **System**: System operations such as PDF extraction, directory creation, and message display.
- **Elements**: Manipulation of web page elements using Selenium.
- **CLI**: Command-line interface to simplify task execution.
