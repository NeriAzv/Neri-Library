Introduction to Neri Library
============================
The Neri Library is a PORTIFOLIO where interested parties can study my codes or assess my knowledge.

I created this advanced Python library for task automation, browser interaction, API manipulation, and more, all aimed at RPA processes. It is designed to facilitate the creation of robust and efficient scripts, especially for web scraping and integration with third-party programs.

Key Features:

- **Driver**: Initialize various browsers with stealth configurations (to avoid CAPTCHAs and others), bug prevention (like starting in the same version as your machine's browser), and simplified functions such as adding extensions and other useful arguments for customization. All this is already implemented, minimizing the amount of code in your script while reducing bugs and complexity.
- **API**: Integration with external APIs for HTTP requests allowing manipulate apis with all methods avaliables.
- **System**: System operations such as UI manipulations, Files extraction (like pdf), directory creation, message display and others.
- **Elements**: Manipulation of web page elements using Selenium, containing various tools that i have created helping to pass across captchas and extract data; or tools and functions of selenium that i optimized and added new funcionalities.
- **CLI**: CMD tool totally autoral, it can generates executables of your python script with all dependencies inclued, beeing possible run the code in machines with no preparation and with out install python or dependencies necessity. It can also manipulate .venvs, hidden imports and others features avaliables in command ``--help`` of the tool.
